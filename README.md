# Web Development Internship Task 7: Fetch and Display Data from a Public API

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of the JavaScript Fetch API to retrieve user data from a public API (`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users`) and display it on a webpage. The webpage shows user names, emails, and addresses in styled cards, includes a reload button to refetch data, and handles errors gracefully.

## Files
- **index.html**: The HTML structure for the webpage, including a container for user data and a reload button.
- **style.css**: CSS file to style the webpage and user data cards.
- **script.js**: JavaScript file that fetches data from the API, parses JSON, displays user data, and handles errors.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Features
- Fetches user data from `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users` using the Fetch API.
- Displays user name, email, and address in styled cards.
- Includes a reload button to refetch data.
- Handles network errors and displays error messages.
- Responsive design with CSS styling.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser (preferably Chrome) to view the webpage.
3. Ensure you have an active internet connection to fetch data from the API.
4. To test error handling, disable your internet connection and click the reload button.

## Tools Used
- **VS Code**: For writing and editing code.
- **Chrome Browser**: For testing and viewing the webpage.
- **Public API**: `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users` for mock user data.

## Key Concepts
- Fetch API
